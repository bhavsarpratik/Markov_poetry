# Markov Poetry   
A script to generate random poetry using **NLTK Corpus** and **Markov chains**       

## Generated poetry

           
Father white he kissed child hand   
Led and mother brought who sorrow pale lonely dale    
The little boy weeping sought laughing song      


Deep while deserts weep tired woe begone    
Hoarse making moan arm arm seven days    
They traced desert ways seven nights sleep among shadows    
Deep and dream see child starved desert    
Wild pale pathless ways the fancied image    
Strays famished weeping weak with hollow
